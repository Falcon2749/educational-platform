# Educational platform
Educational platfrom as I see it.   

All of that I want to implement:
- [x] Registration
- [x] Login page
- [x] Roles and permissions access
- [ ] MyAccount page
- [ ] Progress tracking
- [ ] Bases of tests
- [ ] Teacher page
- [ ] Grades for homework
- [ ] Lectures and etc. 

For now, registration, login, roles/permissions access and basic myaccount page is ready.
In this project I am using Spring Boot, Spring Security and Thymeleaf(not completely sure it is good practice(using Thymeleaf then frontend and back-end are splitted), 
but it is convinient for me).

Just want to try my hand. Writing this project to learn new technologies.
