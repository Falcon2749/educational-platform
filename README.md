# Educational-platform
Educational platfrom as I see it. Login page, myaccount page, progress tracking etc. All of want I want to implement.
For now, login and basic myaccount page is ready.
In this project I am using Spring Boot, Spring Security and Thymeleaf(not completely sure it is good practice(using Thymeleaf then frontend and back-end are splitted), 
but it is convinient for me).

Just want to try my hand. Writing this project to learn new technologies.
